# EatSafe
An app for avoiding botulism

## Installing

You must first install [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/download/). It's sufficient to just install
the Scala binary, as everything related to Typesafe Activator that you may need is included with
the repo. You'll need Scala 2.11.5 (later will probably work -- that's the current version at the
time of writing).

With Scala installed and in the system path, you simply have to use the following command while in
the project directory (the one this file is located in).

```
./activator ~run
```

The above command is for Linux systems. For Windows, use `./activator.bat` for the file (for
Cygwin on Windows, use the Linux file -- the Linux file has been slightly modified for better
Cygwin support).

If you exclude the `~run`, you'll enter the activator console, in which you can execute commands
such as `~run` in the context of the program (the above command is simply more direct). The `run`
command runs the server. The `~run` command does the same, but also automatically recompiles files
when you change them. This is the ideal way to run the server for development.

You'll also find `./activator ~test` to be useful. It works like the above command, but instead just
runs tests.

Note that the first run will be considerably slower than subsequent runs because Activator (actually
SBT under the hood) must find and download all dependencies.

Once SBT has compiled everything, you'll see a message like:

```
[info] play - Listening for HTTP on /0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:9000
```

This means that everything worked and the server can be viewed in any web browser at
`http://localhost:9000/`.
