This folder contains the files that needed for building the database, using the previous method. 

Using the new parser program, a complete SQL file will be generated to build and populate the database. 

Those files are put there for backup and test purpose.

For test: can use those files to build a DB, then use query to compare with the DB that constructed using new parser.
